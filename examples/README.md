# Examples

This directory contains various working examples of using eda. Some of them may be generic enough to use in your own system, such as the [stdout](./stdout) or [neo4j-causal-graph](./neo4j-causal-graph) consumers. Others are to demonstrate use cases like [aggregated-state](./aggregated-state). Each example has a README describing the dependencies and how to run it.

### Contributions are welcome

If you have an example in mind to suggest or contribute, please open an issue or pull request!
